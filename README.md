 # üëã Oh, MSCBM Lab

The **MSCBM Lab** is led by Hemi Luan, PhD, and is a part of the XXX. We work at the intersection of Mass pectrometry and computational biomedicine.The broad goal of our research is to gain mechanistic insights about human health by applying mass spectrometry and computational methods to modern big data.

##Things We work with
Here you can read more about the three main research topics we have at the moment:

#### üî≠ Mass spectrometry
 - The advent of Mass spectrometry (MS)-based omics technologies (Metabolomics, Proteomics) has enabled us to survey the whole metabolites, xenobiotic substance, and proteins from an organism, tissue, cell or biofluid, and decipher molecular mechanisms underlying complex human diseases. The rapid developments in this field have allowed us to generate big data at once, we would like to develop the state-of-the-art MS methods for various analysis tasks and interpreted big data with high quality.
 
   > Software
      - **statTarget**, is a streamlined tool for quality control based signal correction, integration of metabolomics and proteomics data from multi-batch experiments, and the comprehensive statistic analysis (`URL: https://stattarget.github.io`). The statTarget has two basic sections. The first section is  `Signal Correction`. It includes ‚ÄòEnsemble Learning‚Äô for QC based signal correction. For example, QC-based random forest correction (QC-RFSC) and QC-based LOESS signal correction (QCRLSC).The second section is `Statistical Analysis`. It provides comprehensively computational and statistical methods that are commonly applied to analyze Omics data, and offers multiple results for biomarker discovery. The  `statTargetGUI` provides the simple easy to use interface for the above functions, which have been online at a stand-alone app [statTargetAPP](https://github.com/statTarget/statTarget2/releases).The package version is at bioconductor with [statTarget](https://bioconductor.org/packages/statTarget/).(Anal Chim Acta. 2018, 1036, 66-72.)![statTarget](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/13479776/Picture/master/shiftC-14.jpg)
