 # ðŸ‘‹ Oh, MSCBM Lab

The **MSCBM Lab** is led by Hemi Luan, PhD, and is a part of the XXX. We work at the intersection of Mass pectrometry and computational biomedicine.The broad goal of our research is to gain mechanistic insights about human health by applying mass spectrometry and computational methods to modern big data. 

## ðŸ”§ Things We work with
Here you can read more about the three main research topics we have at the moment:

#### ðŸ”­ Mass spectrometry
 - The advent of Mass spectrometry (MS)-based omics technologies (Metabolomics, Proteomics) has enabled us to survey the whole metabolites, xenobiotic substance, and proteins from an organism, tissue, cell or biofluid, and decipher molecular mechanisms underlying complex human diseases. The rapid developments in this field have allowed us to generate big data at once, we would like to develop the state-of-the-art methods for various sentiment analysis tasks and interpreted big data with high quality.

#### ðŸ¤” Computational biomedicine

#### âš¡ Percision Medicine
